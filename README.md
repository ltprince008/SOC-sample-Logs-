This repository contains a synthetic dataset of Security Operations Center (SOC) logs created for training and practice. The logs simulate real-world security events such as login attempts, malware detections (Trojan, Rootkit, Ransomware, Worm, Spyware), and suspicious activity from external IP addresses.

The dataset is designed for beginners and students who want hands-on experience with:

Log analysis using the command line (grep, awk, etc.)

Building dashboards in Splunk or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Practicing alert classification (High / Medium / Low)

Developing incident timelines and writing incident response reports

All logs are safe and synthetic — no malicious code, only text entries — making it a beginner-friendly resource for labs, workshops, and self-study.
